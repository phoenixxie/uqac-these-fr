One forms a formalization of the method of intermittent assertions, while the other is an adaptation of the tense logic system Kb, and is particularly suitable for reasoning about concurrent programs.},

   abstract = {Bitmap indexes must be compressed to reduce input/output costs and minimize CPU usage. To accelerate logical operations (AND, OR, XOR) over bitmaps, we use techniques based on run-length encoding (RLE), such as Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression. These techniques are sensitive to the order of the rows: a simple lexicographical sort can divide the index size by 9 and make indexes several times faster. We investigate row-reordering heuristics. Simply permuting the columns of the table can increase the sorting efficiency by 40%. Secondary contributions include efficient algorithms to construct and aggregate bitmaps. The effect of word length is also reviewed by constructing 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit indexes. Using 64-bit CPUs, we find that 64-bit indexes are slightly faster than 32-bit indexes despite being nearly twice as large.},

   abstract = {Bit arrays, or bitmaps, are used to significantly speed up set operations in several areas, such as data warehousing, information retrieval, and data mining, to cite a few. However, bitmaps usually use a large storage space, thus requiring compression. Consequently, there is a space–time tradeoff among compression schemes. The Word Aligned Hybrid (WAH) bitmap compression trades some space to allow for bitwise operations without first decompressing bitmaps. WAH has been recognized as the most efficient scheme in terms of computation time. In this paper we present Concise (Compressed ‘n’ Composable Integer Set), a new scheme that enjoys significantly better performances than WAH. In particular, when compared to WAH our algorithm is able to reduce the required memory up to 50%, while having comparable computation time. Further, we show that Concise can be efficiently used to represent sets of integral numbers in lieu of well-known data structures such as arrays, lists, hashtables, and self-balancing binary search trees. Extensive experiments over synthetic data show the effectiveness of our proposal.},

   abstract = {Compressed bitmap indexes are used to speed up simple aggregate queries in databases. Indeed, set operations like intersections, unions and complements can be represented as logical operations (AND,OR,NOT) that are ideally suited for bitmaps. However, it is less obvious how to apply bitmaps to more advanced queries. For example, we might seek products in a store that meet some, but maybe not all, criteria. Such threshold queries generalize intersections and unions; they are often used in information-retrieval and data-mining applications. We introduce new algorithms that are sometimes three orders of magnitude faster than a naive approach. Our work shows that bitmap indexes are more broadly applicable than is commonly believed.},
