Information technology has become an important part of our lives. Although lots of great techniques make us live easy and comfortable, accidents and disasters caused by software malfunctioning cost much losses of lives and wealth which actually can be avoided. Software verification and validation is a set of techniques aiming to verify the functionality and evaluate the software quality. Runtime verification is one of the techniques widely used in the industry. It has its origin from other verification techniques but it also has its own features and characteristics.

The goal of this research is to explore methods and solutions to improve two aspects of runtime verification: data collection and formul\ae{} evaluation. In the first part, we present an one-way communication channel based on optical codes which is applicable for data transmission in some specific environment. Then in the second part, we introduce our solution of offline evaluation of temporal logics based on bitmap manipulation and bitmap compression. Both parts were written in papers for publication, one of which has been published, while another one is under review.
